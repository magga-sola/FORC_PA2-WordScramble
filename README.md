# PA2-WordScramble

main.cpp is for version A 

in order to compile and run the program:
>g++ -o m.exe main.cpp
> ./m.exe

We attempted version B (only works on mac) => We tested the code and it seems to only work on macs due to an allocating memory issue (at least that's what we think)
>g++ -o w.exe word_jumble.cpp
> ./w.exe
